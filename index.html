<p>I am expected to graduate at the end of 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Information Systems, and a Russian Studies minor.
    I am currently employed as a penetration tester at TBG Security, and aim
    to have a successful career in the security field. I am particularly interested in Red Team work. I am a U.S. Army
    veteran who enjoys woodworking in his free time.</p>
